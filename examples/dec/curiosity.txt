Is there anything that we associate more closely with intelligence than curiosity? Every intelligent species on Earth is attracted by the unknown. Our mythologies are full of riddles and mysteries and divine knowledge. Even the word "apocalypse". Even the word "apocalypse" means revelation.

It seems like our ancestors always imagined that even at the very end, we would solve one last mystery.
